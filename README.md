# reference_sheets

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of commonly used Git, Linux, Python, and development tools used in astronomy, Python, and Linux-based development environments. It is designed to provide me with a convenient way to recall solutions and workflows specific to astronomy research and software development, without needing to google or ask chat gpt, ensuring a smoother and more efficient workflow. Think of it as "figure it out once, and write it down â€” instead of forgetting in a few months." Not intended as tutorials, you should always make your own reference sheets.
